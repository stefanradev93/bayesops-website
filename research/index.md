## Research Agenda

Our research follows two general streams:
- Developing new Bayesian methods through the emerging generation of generative AI. 
- Crafting computational models of complex systems to gain insights from (big) data.

These two streams converge at the [BayesFlow framework](https://bayesflow.org) for Bayesian inference with modern deep learning.
The list below provides a small, but representative sample of our recent research outcomes.

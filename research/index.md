Our research follows two streams: 
- The first focuses on developing new Bayesian methods through the emerging generation of generative neural networks. 
- The second focuses on building and applying computational models of complex processes to gain insights from data.

These two streams converge at our BayesFlow framework for Bayesian inference with modern deep learning.

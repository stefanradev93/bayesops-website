## Research Agenda

At BayesOps, our research follows two general streams:
- Developing new probabilistic methods through the emerging generation of generative neural networks. 
- Building and applying computational models of complex processes to gain insights from data.

These two streams converge at the [BayesFlow framework](https://bayesflow.org) for Bayesian inference with modern deep learning.
The list below provides a small, but representative sample of our research topics.

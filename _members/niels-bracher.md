Niels is conducting research using generative models to address questions in the natural sciences, specifically focusing on improving methods for optimal design and simulation-based inference in neuroimaging. His research interests include: 

- Adaptive Bayesian design optimization
- Real-time inference and uncertainty quantification,
- Robust inference from complex, high-fidelity data in low-data regimes

He is co-supervised by Dr. Xavier Intes from the awesome [Functional & Molecular Optical Imaging Laboratory](https://intes-lab.bme.rpi.edu/).

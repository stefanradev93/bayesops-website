In this post, Jerry talks about how SBI can be used to model human interactions in immersive rooms.

*Imagine being in a room with a group of friends. The room takes you to a virtual tour of a forest projected all around you. On your journey, you encounter elements of nature's wonders---perhaps a giant puffball mushroom, or a singing bluejay nearby. Curiosity guides you, as it does to your peers.*

***Would you more likely explore this otherworld on your own? Or go with the flow? Or, perhaps, a bit of both?***

Our most familiar experiences of the virtual world has so far been mostly isolated, especially when it is enabled by technologies that cover our eyes and occupy our hands (i.e., VR headsets). However, since the start of this century, there are more and more places where we can experience the virtual world together, without wearing anything that intrudes our senses. These *immersive rooms* can extend beyond themselves, with more and more 3D virtual worlds constructed using game design tools. But very little is known about how these experiences are embodied by multiple at the same time---or, how people physically react to these experiences through the way they move, either on their own or together as a group, based on the perceptual information they are exposed to.

## Own your own vs. with the flow
As humans, we are social animals in the real world.

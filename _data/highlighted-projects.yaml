  description: > 
    BayesFlow is a Python library for simulation-based inference with generative AI. 
    It provides users and researchers with a user-friendly API for rapid Bayesian workflows,
    a rich collection of neural architectures, and multi-backend support via Keras3.

  description: >
    We are developing neural networks that will allow researchers to fit thousands of cognitive 
    models. The project's focus on robust inference and benchmarking
    aims to strenghten the emerging infrastructure for model-based analysis in the behavioral sciences.

  description: >
    Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful backbones for simulation-based inference. 
    The projects aims to provide the most comprehensive evaluation of their accuracy for Bayesian 
    tasks and push new frontiers, such as hierarchical Bayesian modeling and Bayesian adaptive design.

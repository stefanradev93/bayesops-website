  description: >
    In this NSF-funded project, we will develop a scalable framework for efficient Bayesian inference, enabling researchers to build, 
    fit, and adapt thousands of cognitive models within a single network. The project's strong focus on robust inference and benchmarking
    aims to strenghten the broader scientific infrastructure for model-based research in the behavioral and cognitive sciences.
